This is a prototype page to estimate inventory needed for a chain of cookie stands. For each location it calculates an estimated number of cookies needed for each day by projecting hourly sales.

I worked on it myself on Monday Nov. 2;
Partnered with Melissa on Tuesday Nov.3;
Partnered with Miranda on Wednesday Nov.4.
